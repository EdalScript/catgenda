# Catgenda App

 A small colourful agenda-like app to store and display your contacts in an interactive way. We all miss or forget specific information about our contacts-- where they are originally from, their birthday, their most favourite thing in the world, right? I hope you are not that kind of terrible person that forget that kind of information, but there wouldn't be any need to feel guilty with Catgenda. When you hover on one of the cards, it will turn around and display more information about your contact!
